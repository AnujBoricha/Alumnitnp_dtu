Dear Alumni,
On Behalf of DTU, it is my pleasure to welcome you to the Alumni Affairs Section of the DTU.
The world gets more complicated with every passing day. We get involved with our families and work and suddenly we’ve lost touch with those outside that close circle. This Alumni Affairs Portal can help you stay connected to those friends and to the Students and faculty in the University.This Portal is designed to support you as you pursue your post-academic life and career.

The DTU, DCE, DP alumni family is huge.Today the fame each member of this family earns that add a shine to the University too. After all, your success is our success.At the same time, I would challenge you to think of ways you can give back to the University to whatever degree you are comfortable. And I do not mean just monetarily, though that is, of course, always welcome. There are many ways to give back, from career and academic mentoring to volunteering time at on- and off-campus events to simply attending academic and social events. And let’s not forget athletics. Rooting for the Great Danes in whatever sports appeal to you is always a fun and exciting time and a great way to connect and reconnect with old friends. As you will find, giving back has another benefit: it feels good.

So thank you for visiting with us today, and please come back often. I encourage you to explore all that we have to offer to stay connected and make yourself and DTU stronger.
